                   "Our Days are but a passing dream, everlasting though they seem. Our memories remain, " <br> - <em>Brook (One Piece)</em>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Now I actually went through a dilemma , I had another quote "Wake up to reality ... " by Madara (Naruto) it is more of a speech but it is really good to hear and understand so check it out after reading this. That quote mentioned above is not even a quote , it is just an extract of a song from the anime , I liked it so much so made it a quote for myself. Now to someone who is new to this vast domain of stories and emotions might sound little incomprehensible but i can not explain the basics of anime so I assume you have watched at least a handful of anime series and movies.</p>
                
                <h3> Decoding actually begins</h3>
                <p>Let us jump directly on the topic because it is night time and you are fully aware of my brain performance with respect to time of the day. I myself have watched a lot of anime and became able to understand a few things. Some of them are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Death Note : In this anime, aside from the iconic clash between 2 brilliant minds , I could learn deducing skills, narrowing things down to come to precise anticipation, trying to think like your opponent, like Detective Sherlock Holmes said, after eliminating the impossibilities we are left with possibilities, this is quite obvious so does not even matter who said , but the thing is the strategy and thought process demonstrated in the story is awesome. It also teaches us power and strength drives us crazy and leads to chaos, we are not responsible enough to handle those great powers also this anime made me question, are all criminal bad? do they deserve death? who are you to decide whom to kill and once you kill a killer , are you not also a killer? so you should be killed too, right? a cluster of weird thoughts to go through in your free time, enjoy!</li><br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Dragon Ball Series: This one is very inspiring, gives  you a lot of goosebumps so get excited, its story made us realize that hardwork is the key, you will always have competition, no sky is not your limit, you can achieve multiple breakthroughs, also teaches not all aliens are bad, some are better than us humans to the Earth, I mean Goku and Vegeta came to Earth and saved earth , got married and had a family, vegeta came on a mission to destroy the Earth and now look, he has 2 cute kids, you should be careful while judging someone's heart, you never know what's hidden in the thick layer of flesh, rest think of yourself.</li><br>
                    <br>
                    <li>One Piece: This anime makes you realize what your true life is, no just jumping on the bandwagon is not your life, it is te default life for those who can not think, for someone as sharp and creative as you , you should think about your true passion and dreams. Luffy's dream to be the King of the Pirates was childish from the beginning , yes all of ours dreams sound childish and hilarious in the beginnig but you should never give up, even if it takes your life , you should feel happy to dedicate your life in your passion,it is why you are here and if you dont follow it you are not alive, luffy says. </li><br><br>
                    <li>Dr. Stone: This anime gave me a full recap of how humanity reached this stage, seriously, this is the best sci-fi anime I ever watched, let us not talk about the fact that I have watched only one anime falling in that cateogory , whatever when I say it is good , it is good. This made me feel assured by relying on science, would you be able to create everything from the scratch if you had enough work force and the resources? by everything I mean everything you have seen or used yesterday, comb, car,mobile, house, soap lol the order is so random even i dont know  also this anime teaches you the power of unity and hardwork, humanity is up above all forms of barriers</li><br><br>
                    <li>Solo Levelling: This is some real stuff lol, this anime is so cool and popular you know why? because it is very simple the writer or creator is very smart and is taking advantage of this generation by writing the story in a way that every gamer kid tries to relate it to their life and makes it popular in reutrn. A character who is weak, poor and definitely not handsome gets picked as a player in a weird real life game like system. here we can clearly see that the writer is trying to get this relatable to us by making the character initially poor, weak and bad looking, and when this character figures out he is the only one with this game like system and this system can help him grow stronger sharper and more handsome, all of the middle class kids are psychologically attacked and they feel like they are the main character and even start to assume watching it makes them stronger and they are actually making progress in their real life. <br> Just think of it yourself , imagine yourself in this middle class kid character , what do you want ? to get stronger? wish granted now by doing daily missions and quests you can make progress, you want money? booM! now you are stronger so you get a fighting job which makes you even stronger , you want girls(btw dont objectify anyone,no intentions,just for example)? well about that the writer has ensured this too, of course you are strong and getting rich not to mention getting more and more physically attractive too, why would not anyone fall for you? that is exactly how the current world works so yes. Now what else do you want ?nothing , now the kid is in illusion and this starts to affect his real life. How to fix this ?? later!!! </li><br><br>
                    <li>Classroom Of The Elites: This is also very similar to the last one , just the difference is , the character is not using a some sort of game like system and does not possesses inhuman strengths, the character is very clever, smart and strong, and in this the writer tries to attack high school students by making ths story happen in a lavish high school , even just the setting is enough to put the imaginative audience into day dreaming,you have not even seen the actual story yet,same stuff as mentioned above happen here too and lots of people are stuck in real life assuming themselves the main character of the anime. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>How to fix the illusion them? how to break the curse??</h2>
                <p> Well, it is simple, dont consider it as a threat , take it as a challenge , you know they say, "What does not kill you, makes you only stronger ", take it like an opportunity that came to you with a price to pay, now that you have payed the price , you shall get the product then, so the thing is the anime is not wrong , it is just good to put people into illusion. <br> I can not promise you inhuman strength or capabilities but I can definitely assure you success if you apply the same idea in your life. Make yourself like a gamer in the system in your real life and actual studying , exercising and socializing increases your real stats, and of course your physical appearance , skills , capabilities and social prestige makes you better person in your life, makes you successful and actually helps you get everything you want and we talked about earlier. So! there is a way to get that inhuman anime moment in real life? well,yes not exactly but you can get close to it and it will feel great.</p>
                
                <p> You must have watched some anime where the main character is like crazy powreful and none is match to it, or the character is losing and what do you say infront of the screen at that time? go and train , get stronger you fool, you must have yelled this at your screen , but what if i say this same to you , just think or assume , your grand grand grand son/daughter is came timetravelling and looked at you and said, work hard goddamit , you lazy sh*t and disappeared , now you realize if you actually work like how the anime MC did and got stronger , you can get somewhat stronger and better and your future will be proud of you. You can easily brag your success and that is what you get in return, you get a good family too.</p>
                
                <p>Remember that, it is on you to find motivation and insipration, motivators are useless if you dont have any intentions to grow, so it is on you and anime can be very good way to learn to be emotional and rational and obviously many more. It's 11:15 now and I got to publish this before I sleep so thanks a lot for reading up to here, of course it is on you to keep thinking on these topics because I am unable to give my best as I am not employed at writing these so appreciate what you get lol. Hehehe thanks a lot again😊</p>
