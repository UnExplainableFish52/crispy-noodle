                <p> Hello Fellow traveller , thank you for providing me some of your valuable time even while you are dying. Yes , you are dying , if that makes you feel uncomfortable then let me help you , not just you , I am dying too and I have invested a lot of time in making these writings possible so I would argue that this is a fair trade with your time but today let's discuss on a different topic , a mysterious topic that people can not understand , so mysterious that people find it dumb and irrelevant but little do they know their whole life would be senseless without this mysterious thing, it is no other thing but our happiness. </p>
                
                <h2>What in the universe is "Happiness" anyway?</h2>
                <p> Happiness , for most of us it is a pretty common word with a lot of definitions. Neurologists, Ordinary people , Advertisers , Political leaders , Teachers , Business peoples , Fighters and also homeless people, I am sure they all can define this term in their unique way, but whom should you listen to ? hehehehe while you are here , could you please listen to mine?🥺 </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "If you don't find happiness in your life ,#LABEL look for it again , if you still don't find it , then read again from #LABEL , it is always around you but it might be blocked by the clouds infront of your eyes  " - Saksham
                </blockquote>
                
                <p> Yes, I made that up in the last minute but it is not pure nonsense , let me explain, but before that we would need to define the term first. For most of you, 99.999% of the population , happiness is Wealth , Enjoyment , Party and a lavish life. I can not claim that they are wrong tho, they are correct in their own ways, yes all those things does sound tempting , but only to someone who doesn't really understand the world. </p>
                
                <h3>What is Happiness to me then? Do you really want to know ?</h3>
                <p>ok then , let me think about them, infact we can think together , let's do this right now. </p>
                <p><i>thinking...</i></p>
                <p>I think it should be something like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Giving Up your greeds:</strong> Your greeds and tension make you constantly worried and unhappy. </li>
                    <li><strong>Uncertainity of the Future:</strong> You are constantly worried about the future and all the responsibilities overwhelm you , you think that you are responsible for everything and somehow believe that you can do it all by yourself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embracing the reality:</strong> You little integration of different atoms really think you can do everything you dream, then you start dreaming more silly things and try to make them happen without realizing how fragile your life and the world to you really is.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value the Present:</strong> Master Oogway beutifully said,"Yesterday is a history, tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift, that is why it is also called Present" You little human really think you can finish all your works today? then what would you do tomorrow ? if you strain yourself with all that pressure , it wont take much before you get cooked. Instead of stacking up, building the pressure , learn to live everyday in a constant way, I mean , you should not order Caviar today if you cant afford dinner tomorrow, likewise try to make a balance in your life. You deserve to smile everyday, don't you?</li>
                    <li><strong> Contagiousness:</strong> Yes, Happiness and Positivity are actually contagious, trying to imply that bringing simle on other's face brings similar outcome on your face too.
                    As I always say, You don't know what the other is going through so just  spreading some positivity won't hurt you.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2> Life is a journey & Happiness is not your destination</h2>
                <p> Dont be foolish, happiness was never your destination, your destination is actually death and happiness is actually the path you should walk on to reach to your destination and pass away peacefully or your soul will keep wandering in search of happiness. </p>
                
                <p>Listen! you are an ambitious little human, you have goals , you have job, dreams and stuff , do you know what you dont have ? a life , you may find these silly but when you think of these and in the right time you will slowly begin to realize that you have been chasing the wrong light bulb and your wings have already fallen(you are a mayfly insect). </p>

                <p>
                    You are never sure that if you will be waking up to see tomorrow's sunrise or not, so why all those worries, arrogance and greeds? instead you can do something like being humble , grateful to live each day , you might be having a good time but there are a lot of people struggling to survive because of deficiency , perhaps you could try that theory of Contagiousness of Happiness. Perhaps you could not shout at those (comparatively in worse condition) low level workers , homeless & uneducated peoples. Perhaps the world would be different if you stop treating eachother like objects and they mean nothing to you. </p>
                    <p>
                        You are not an american, you are not a chinese , you are not a nepali , you are not a rich , you are not a poor , you are a human and we all are humans , we all are the same , we all are equal , we all are dying , we all are living , if a breakthrough occurs in any field , you should not think of others as your potential customers but as part of your own family. Let the world have brotherhood, no there is no such thing as sisterhood , brotherhood does not make you my brother , rather it makes you a part of my family, our family. By this way, even if one is in desparate situation , poor and lonely in a foreign country, one would not die, we all are humans after all, we all need to do the same things to keep us alive , I agree you might not understand Mandarin, Russian , English , Japanese or Nepali but how could you not uderstand the language of Humanity? It is not something we speak, it is something we express. </p>
                
                <p> My apologies, I feel like I talked nonsense again, let me make myself clear again. </p>
                <p> 

                    <blockquote>
                        "Happiness is not a destination, it is a path you should walk on to reach to your destination and pass away peacefully or your soul will keep wandering in search of happiness" - Saksham

                </p>
                <p>As the qoute suggests and I have been trying to say, Happiness is always around us but sometimes it is visible and obvious but sometimes it is not. Our happiness depends upon many factors but some of the main factors affecting it are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our perceptions</li>
                        <li>People we interact with</li>
                        <li>Our nature</li>
                        <li>Our luck</li>
                        <li>Our deeds</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can hack the matrix by with eachother's help, only if we believe in eachother and take all of us as one family without greed, deception , trechery and enviousness we keep on working , together and stronger , we advance , we don't compete or get envious , we support eachother , your loss our loss , your win is our win, just like how in a family, your dad gets happy when you win an award , he is not like shoot, I could not win any award when I was small and I am jealous or something like that but he supports you , encourages you to advance further and keep winnig. </p>
                </p>
                
                <h2>How to live before you die then?</h2>
                <p>Well , Steve Jobs once said , live today as if you are dying tomorrow. Now this might sound great when reading or hearing but when you acutally consider and try to apply it then you realize that it is almost impossible. 
                    <i> <br> <br>
                        Imagine you are starting your first day of summer vacation with 2,000$ with you and sddenly you remember this , what do you do? go and party?</i> <br>If you do that and somehow you dont die and you get to live another day (which is usually what happens with 99.99999% of us), what would you do then? you have already spent all your money, and here comes the idea to bring a balance in your life. Now think of the same situation but this time you are smart and have done the maths an pre plannings , you allocate the money appropriately for each days such that you try to get the required minimum enjoyment that you need while staying in the budget throught the summer, you dont know how much you will get to live and enjoy so you take a slow and steady pace in a long term. This is what we are recommended to do by the society, and it does make some sense although Steve Jobs would find this as a counter attack to his ideas. </p>
                
                <p>Remember that you are not forced to follow the Rat Trap , you can think of a solution to get out on your own too, I just try to trigger the overthinking you into activation and then rest will happen automatically. I am sorry for not matching content worth your time but I hope to be able to match upto peoples expectation in the upcoming writings, dont forget that taking pressure makes you unhappy  so live to the moment and dont have high expectations.
